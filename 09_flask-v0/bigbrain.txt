K09 -- Frameworks, Flask, Greatness, and Duckies!

Summary:
We talked about frameworks, VENVS, and gave our duckies a name.

Questions:

Q0: Where have you seen similar syntax in other langs?
I remember seeing something similar in Java. In Java, you start off with the class name and in parentheses is the constructor. 
Perhaps we are creating a Flask object using this (__name__) constructor?

Q1: What points of reference do you have for meaning of '/'?
This reminds me of directories (and webpage urls which also utilize directories). / is generally used to mark off folder and directory paths.
the "app.route("/")" might imply that the route we are working with is the root directory, since the only marker we have there is the slash.

Q2: Where will this print to? Q3: What will it print?
It seems to me that it will print in the terminal/console, since it seems like a basic print statement inside of a normal function.

Q3: Will this appear anywhere? How u know?
I don't believe that it will print anywhere, nor return anything, because the hello_world() function was not called anywhere. Perhaps
hello_world maybe be a method that we are overriding, or something of the sort but to my knowledge I don't see a way for this function to
be called and do anything.

Q4: Where have you seen similar construcs in other languages?
This reminds me of Java/OOP once again. In OOP, we have objects, which in turn have methods. I remember from Java calling methods of an 
object by writing .methodName(), with whatever parameters desired in the parentheses. It seems like we are telling a Flask object, stored 
under app, to run.

Comments:
Ducks are cool. Frameworks seem interesting; I'm excited to start learning tools to be a SoftDev!
