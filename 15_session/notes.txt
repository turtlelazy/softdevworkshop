K15 -- Sessions Greetings -- Login and Cookies
2021-10-18

Summary:
Cookies are stored locally. We use something called sessions to store the cookies.
Something cool is that we can check for existence of a key by doing 
session['key']. We can utilize cookies to keep track of sessions and the user logged in. 

We also learned about error handling. Generally it is better to have a conditional
to deal with potential errors, since it uses up less resources compared to having
the try catch statement. However, in the case that errors do pop up, a try/catch
makes it so that the user can continue using the site despite weird bugs that may occur.

Questions:
What exactly is the difference between POST and GET and the other types? I understand 
them somewhat in the context of APIs, but my group did not have or remember
the experience of creating such requests in a meaningful manner. For this assignment
we utilized them to seperate input information and what to look at for the login page.
Furthermore, how can we apply this concept of POST and GET in Flask (or whatever other frameworks).

Comments:
This assignment took longer than usual assignments. The concepts were interesting and more fun
to play around with. We also thought of different ways to handle the website redirecting 
and authflow, along with other things we noticed with forms and Jinja.
