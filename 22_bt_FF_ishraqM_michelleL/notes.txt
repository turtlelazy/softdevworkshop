2021-November-30
Time Spent: 0.8

Questions:
What is a framework and how does it make our life easier?

What is the differences between the frameworks? (BT and FD?)

Comments:
I've heard that frameworks are very slow and take a much longer time to load.
For this reason, they're powerful for things like prototypes and hackathons,
but notorious when it comes to published sites. 

Discoveries:
- Cooler font and font styling options!
- Adaptable CSS according to screen size! (col-sm-6)
- Overall, very quick and clean method of inserting styling.

Summary:
Bootstrap framework works by utilizing class names, with the desired stylizing
inside of the class tag. Any number of class tags can be used, which means
any number of desired styling can be used. There are numbers and classes that
provide different effects, and consulting the docs 
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/
is useful in this reguard.
