Summary:
what is a relational database
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_commands.htm
need semicolon at end of line for sqlite commands when using in terminal (need to explore python)


Important Basic Commands to Remember:
#remember to use SEMICOLONS AFTER INPUTTING COMMANDS

CREATE TABLE <tableName> (name TEXT, id INTEGER); #variable name then variable type

INSERT INTO <tableName> VALUES; ("whose-it", 2); #like a dictionary

SELECT * FROM <tableName>; #prints <tableName> values
SELECT name FROM <tableName>; #prints value at key

SELECT <key> FROM <tableName> WHERE <keyValue> = <value>; #searches by keyvalue
Questions:
Is there an easier way to interface sqlite through python? We are currently accessing it through strings that in turn
utilize sqlite through the cursor (at least thats what it seems), but can we simply call something like,
cursor.select() and gain contents of cursor that way?

Furthermore, can we create objects, format their type, and input it into sqlite more easily?

Comments:
So far, sqlite seems like a pain, and it hurts with the way we're managing it through strings. We hope for an easier more
intuitive way to access the db's.
