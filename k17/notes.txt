Summary:
We had code review in class, so that we could see what other groups did and better methods they utilized for using SQlite and doing
the prompt. 
Some things very useful are...
    the use of triple quotes ("""TRIPLE QUOTES""").
    f string, with brackets in the string allowing us to replace it with what we want
    c.executemany... which lets us executemany (this lets us get rid of the messy for loop)

Afterwards, we took a look at POO and came up with a design doc for it.

Comments:
Our team's method was slightly messy, but did work. We can definitely utilize these new techniques we learned to 
clean it up and improve sustainability.

Questions:
Wouldn't it be better to store our design information as an .md file, utilizing markdown as needed and having an easy to view format?
