2021 - 10 - 6

Questions:
Why is it necessary to have a static page? Can't we simply leave the loading of the static page to the user 
accessing the server or having a function in flask that doesn't change?


Comments:
We have a Cool static Page for the Cool Dogs.

Summary:
We utilized explored static sites through flask. We had a folder called static, which we accessed by traveling through /static being tagged
on to the url. We messed around with some html, exploring the premade static materials and creating our own static site displaying our roster.
