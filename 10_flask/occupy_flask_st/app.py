k10 -- Flask Greatness -- Exploration of Flask framework -- We explored written code to understand flask and created our own code
2021 - 10 - 4

Questions:
Is there a way to make formatting things easier? Current we have to manually put in br tags and what not, but how can we make this formatting easier?
Does the @app.rout("/") specify that the output of hello_world is what should be put in that route?

Comments:
This task seemed relatively easy. We utilized code that was prebuilt and put 1 and 1 together to create 2.

Summary:
We utilized the flask code we explored earlier on to create a website to randomly select an occupation. We also reused code from k06 
to randomly select an occupation.
