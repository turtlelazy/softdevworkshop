k06 -- Weighted Probability
2021-9-28

#SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION:
We mainly worked together figuring out how to read in CSVs, and conceptualizing how to best do weighted randomness.

#QUESTIONS 
What is the better way to do weighted averages? Our group felt that utilizing a list or dictionaries 
this manner had to be vastly inferior and ineffecient compared to the best solution,
despite not knowing what the best solution is.

#Discoveries:
We mainly just figured out how reading in CSV files works.

#Comments:
This method also limits scalability. If sig figs increase, some code has to be created
in response.

    #Likeliness of passing total is proportional to its percentage
