Notes:

Jinja makes it easier to input variables from our Flask app. We can enter variables to render our HTML
through our template, and in this case we pushed through our random occupation and csv file information
into the template. This might make it easier to put in other types of data, like say a list of
rubber duckies types or book genres.

When a webpage refreshes, it runs from the function, but the python script itself is running from the same spot.
We learned this the hard way when we had our random occupation set as a variable in the beginning and wouldn't
change after refreshing.
