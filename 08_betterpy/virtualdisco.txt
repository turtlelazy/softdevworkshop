K08 -- Magical Command
2021 - 9 - 30

Summary:
After running it, we decided to break it down. Python3 indicated we were running something python related. Afterward, there was "-m", 
so we searched for what -m meant. After some snooping, we found it required a module name after it. This led us to search for the module
named venv, which in turn was something that created virtual environments. We checked our root directory and found the magical folder
called myherozero, which contained a lot more folders and files within it. We thus concluded, that the command utilized the module
venv to create a virtual environment, in the created folder myherozero.

Questions:
What is a virtual environment? We remembered hearing about it but weren't entirely sure if we really knew what it was.

Comments:
We utilized Python docs for our discovery:
    - https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html?highlight=#cmdoption-m
    - https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
