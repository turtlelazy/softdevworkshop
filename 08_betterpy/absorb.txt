Group 4 - Ishraq Mahid, Michelle Lo, Rengeng Zheng
SoftDev
K08 -- Less Magical Collaboration and Revision
2021 - 9 - 30

Summary:

Reng and Michelle utilized user input to decide whether they should output a random name from either of the classes,
whereas both of my groups chose to not give the user a choice, and just spit out a random student from both classes.
Reng highlighted an interesting tactic, where we utilize a DEBUG boolean in order to help us debug our code and print 
out statements when we need them. When we're done and testing/ready for production, we can simply set the debug to false.

Our tactics for getting weighted probability were pretty similar, as we added percentages consecutively, while choosing a random
number from the range 1-998. I took note of a very ineffecient method, where we can store each thousanth of a percent as a ticket
in a list, from which we can randomly select. This made Reng cringe inwardly. Michelle pointed out a very clean solution,
that utilizes an inbuilt python method that allows for weighted probability (she still made her own weighted probability but wasn't
satisfied and sought potentially better/existing means).

Questions:
What is the "best solution"?

Comments:
Advantage of list method is that it is extremely simple and requires little competent thinking. Meanwhile, the method we all ended
up doing is much quicker, uses less memory, and easily scalable.
